Flutter Developer Assignment with GetX
 Objective:
 Create a mobile application using Flutter that interacts with a RESTful API to display and
 manage a list of tasks. This application should demonstrate your ability to develop a fully
 functional app, including UI/UX design, state management with GetX, advanced API
 integration, and best coding practices.
 Requirements:
 1. App Overview:- The app should have a clean and intuitive UI.- It should display a list of tasks retrieved from a RESTful API.- Users should be able to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
 2. API Integration:- Use a mock RESTful API (you can use
 [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for this purpose).- Fetch a list of tasks from the API and display them in the app.- Implement functionality to add a new task to the list.- Implement functionality to edit an existing task.- Implement functionality to delete a task from the list.- Implement functionality to mark a task as complete or incomplete.
 3. UI/UX Design:- Create a responsive and user-friendly interface.- Use Flutter widgets effectively to design the app.- Provide proper error handling and feedback to the user (e.g., loading indicators, error
 messages).
 4. State Management:- Use GetX for state management.- Ensure that the app handles state changes efficiently.- Implement GetX Controllers and Bindings for managing state and dependencies.
 5. Advanced Features:- Implement search functionality to filter tasks.- Implement pagination for the task list.- Implement sorting functionality (e.g., by date, priority).
